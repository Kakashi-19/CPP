cmath has the math functions of c++
cin >> var; stores int, double, char and strings without spaces in between
getline(cin, var); stores a complete line or string including a space
you can use ar[] when declaring an array but you have to declare its value too at the same time like ar[] = {a, b, c, d}
to assign values later in an array ,you'll have to define the size of the array at the time of declaration of the array
an array can hold only one data type i.e, char ar[], int ar[], double ar[], bool  ar[], float ar[[] etc
pointers are data types which store the address value of a variable (&var)
constructors are functions which are automatially called when initialising an object of that class
constructors can be used to easily assign attributes to the objects according to the class template by taking required att. values as arguments of the cons. function
multiple constructors can be made inside a class to deal with diff. requirements
object methods already have access to the attributes of the object so u dont have to declare the attributes in the function if they are already declared in the class
functions and attributes can be set private so that they cannot be accessed from outside of the class.
making attributes and functions private helps to control their values and stop invalid values to be set to the attribs.
getters and setters fucntions are made to set and get the value of private attributes without allowing the user to input invalid values to the attributes or function
you can inherit from parent class all its functions and the syntax is:
  Class A : public Class B
        {

        };
to inherit values of attributes from parent class constructor you can use the syntax:
    consChild(arg1, arg2 , arg3):consParent(arg1, arg2)
you can inherit all values from parent class but you have to assign those values again in the child class, see BasicOOP5 for reference
